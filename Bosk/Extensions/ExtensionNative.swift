// Chrome's native messaging, for the extensions that talk to an app on this
// Mac — a password manager unlocking with its desktop app, a clipper handing
// a page to a notes app.
//
// Those apps register with Chrome by leaving a small JSON file in Chrome's
// NativeMessagingHosts folder: a name, the program to run, and which
// extensions may run it. Bosk reads the same files, runs the same program
// with the same argument, and speaks the same protocol — each message a
// four-byte length and a line of JSON, over the program's stdin and stdout.
// A host that lists the extension's id among its allowed origins is run;
// any other is not. Some hosts also check which browser is calling and may
// refuse one they don't know; that is theirs to decide.
